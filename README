To install please take the following steps:
-------------------------------------------
 1. If not already done, install nodejs from http://nodejs.org
 2. Install all dependencies by simply typing "npm install"
 3. In order to use grunt to build the sources, please install grunt-cli

		grunt-commandline-interface globally on your computer.
 4. Create an example config-file by running "grunt"
 5. Edit the File according to your needs
 6. Run grunt again to build the sources
 7. Start the server somehow like this "node server.js"
